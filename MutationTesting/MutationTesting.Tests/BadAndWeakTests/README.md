# Weak tests

If we run our tests for this namespace `BadAndWeakTests`, all of them will pass successfully.

And if we go further and analise the tests coverage:

![Source Code Coverage](../../public/source-code-coverage.jpg)

We can see that we got 100% coverage which seems perfect...but it doesn't mean that our code is bullet proof nor our tests well done!

> You must discard the coverage for the `MutationTesting.Tests` project because we don't want to cover our tests but our source code.

You will understand why as soon as you see Stryker in action ðŸ‘‡

Let's run Stryker in our project and analyse the results:

![Stryker Result Errors Console](../../public/stryker-result-errors-console.jpg)

Let's see the generated report:

![Stryker Result Errors Report](../../public/stryker-result-errors-report.jpg)

As we can see, the Stryker could successfully break our calculator source code by inserting some bugs. 
From 4 methods that we have, 3 of them broke which means that our tests are not ðŸ‘‡

### Subtract method bug

![Subtract method bug](../../public/stryker-result-subtract-error-report.jpg)

The Stryker concluded that our tests are weak because the scenario that it tested, replaced the `return minuend - subtrahend` with `return 0` and the tests passed with success.

Go ahead and test the calculator with the following method:

```csharp
    public int Subtract(int minuend, int subtrahend)
    {
        return minuend - subtrahend;
    }
```

You will see that all the tests pass and the test coverage is still 100% ðŸ˜±

### Multiply method bug

![Multiply method bug](../../public/stryker-result-multiply-error-report.jpg)

Once again, Stryker concluded that our tests are weak because the scenario that it tested, replaced the multiplication sign `*` with the division `/` sign and the tests passed with success...

### Divide method bug

![Divide method bug](../../public/stryker-result-divide-error-report.jpg)

In this method, Stryker applied the inverse of the previous method, replacing the `/` sign by `*` sign and the tests passed with success!

Now, let's see how we can improve our tests so they can really test our source code ðŸ‘‡
